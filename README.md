## History

I first wrote this Map back in 2007, and recently picked it up again to make it compatible with modern FA.

## How to Play

TBD

## Known Issues (FAF Version)

- Objectives are only shown briefly at the start, need a persistent display
- Rounds are not clear and should time out.
- Factories do not pause correctly when no more units are available
